<PageDescription>

#### In our classes we introduce you to footwork, bladework, and tactical aspects of this centuries old European martial art. You will learn how to concentrate on your breathing, to calm your mind, to master your emotions and push aside all other distractions, to attend to the most pertinent aspects of what is happening in the moment, to slow down time to see your options clearly, and to execute (or revise) your strategy most effectively.
