## Philosophy
### Performance with adrenaline requires mental disipline
As coaches we believe fencing should teach self control, good-sportsmanship, discipline and team work in a fun and engaging environment. In addition to the technical and tactical aspects of the sport, we look to develop our fencers physiologically and psychologically through a strong understanding of anatomy and sports psychology. We strive to help our students reach their highest potential whether they are looking for a new fitness program, recreational activity or to be competitive
